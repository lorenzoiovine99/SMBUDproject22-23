# Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data project

**Systems and methods for Big and Unstructured Data** project held at Politecnico di Milano in a.y. 2022/2023. 
The aim of the project is to design and implement NoSQL databases for different scenarios.  

**Teacher** Marco Brambilla

## Application Overview

This project aims to build databases with different technologies that handle scientific articles contained in the DBLP bibliography.
The focus is on creating a database which allows efficient information retrieval of the articles.

## First assignment - Neo4J

Design, store and query graph data structures in a NoSQL DB for DBLP bibliography.

Tasks to perform:
* Design conceptual model 
* Store a sample dataset in Neo4J
* Write basic data creation\update Commands (minimum 5)
* Write basic Queries (minimum 10)
* Check complexity and performance time

## Second assignment - MongoDB

Design, store and query documental data structures in a NoSQL DB for DBLP bibliography.

Tasks to perform:
* Design conceptual model 
* Store a sample dataset in MongoDB
* Write basic data creation\update Commands (minimum 5)
* Write basic Queries (minimum 10)
* Check complexity and performance time

## Third assignment - Spark

Design, store and query data structures in a NoSQL DB for DBLP bibliography using Spark.

Tasks to perform:
* Design conceptual model 
* Store a sample dataset in Spark
* Write basic data creation\update Commands (minimum 5)
* Write 10 Queries with the following requirements (provided using their equivalents for simplicity):
    * WHERE, JOIN
    * WHERE, LIMIT, LIKE
    * WHERE, IN, Nested Query
    * GROUP BY, 1 JOIN, AS
    * WHERE, GROUP BY
    * GROUP BY, HAVING, AS
    * WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, AS
    * WHERE, Nested Query (i.e., 2-step Queries), GROUP BY
    * WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, 1 JOIN
    * WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, 2 JOINs
* Check complexity and performance time
