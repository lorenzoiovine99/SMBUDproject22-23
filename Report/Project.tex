% In the main text of your thesis you can write the chapters in two different ways:
%
%(1) As presented in this template you can write:
%    \chapter{Title of the chapter}
%    *body of the chapter*
%
%(2) You can write your chapter in a separated .tex file and then include it in the main file with the following command:
%    \chapter{Title of the chapter}
%    \input{chapter_file.tex}
%
% Especially for long thesis, we recommend you the second option.

\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{2em}} % Add a gap in the Contents, for aesthetics
\mainmatter % Begin numeric (1,2,3...) page numbering

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}%
% The \label{...}% enables to remove the small indentation that is generated, always leave the % symbol.

In this chapter will be presented the problem specification and the hypothesis under which the database is implemented.

\section{Problem Specification}
\label{sec:prob_specs}
This project aims to build an Information System that handles scientific articles contained in the DBLP
bibliography. The project involves managing the type of the articles and the associated DOI (Digital Object Identifier),
which identifies an article or a document and links to it on the web. Other entities to deal with are authors, identified by
an ID or ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), and their affiliations with organizations. In order to address the
problem, we will store data in a graph database, allowing us to visualize relations and handle information correctly.


\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All the data in the dataset are heterogeneous, so fields are different
    \item The \textbf{authors} with missing field \emph{\_id} are not considered
    \item It is possible that an author writes for different organizations
    \item Field \emph{\_id} in \textbf{author} is unique
    \item Field \emph{\_id} in \textbf{article} exists and it is unique
    \item It is impossible that 2 different articles are on the same journal, in the same \emph{volume} with an intersection between \emph{page\_start} and \emph{page\_end}
    \item The designed model doesn't take into consideration the URL associated to the article node, as the main focus of the project was not reading the article
    \item It is possible to find a self-reference in a publication
    \item A \emph{venue} can be instantiated as a journal, a conference or a generic venue!!!!!!!!
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
The ER diagram designed contains the following entities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Publication:} this entity represents all the scientific articles. They are identified by their primary key \emph{\_id}
            and other important attributes are: \emph{DOI, title, last\_edit\_data, abstract, keywords, pages, pub\_date}.
            Of course the attributes of such entity could be enlarged, but as a sample dataset we have believed these are enough.
            Publication entity is the superclass of a Total and Exclusive ISA relationship with the following subclasses:
            \emph{Journal article, Conference \& Workshop paper, Informal publication, Thesis, Book}
    \item \textbf{Author:} it represents all the people that submitted at least one publication. Its primary key is \emph{\_id} and the
            foreign keys are: \emph{name, surname, nationality, paperCount, citationCount}.
            Of course the attributes of such entity could be enlarged, but as a sample dataset we have believed these are enough
    \item \textbf{Venue:} it's the entity that represents the type of a publication. This is a superclass that creates a Partial and Exclusive
            ISA relationship with the two subclasses \emph{Journal} and \emph{Conference}.
            The primary key is \emph{raw} and the other keys are: \emph{name, date, venue\_id}
    \item \textbf{Field Of Study:} this entity represents the topics of the related publication
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

The ER diagram designed contains the following relationships:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Writes:} is the relationship between \emph{author} and \emph{publication} which specifies also the affiliation
            with the org\_id and the org\_name
    \item \textbf{Mentions:} occurs between two \emph{publication} and specifies when a publication refers to another one
    \item \textbf{Is about:} binds a \emph{publication} with its \emph{fields of study}
    \item \textbf{Published on:} simply relates a \emph{publication} to its \emph{venue}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Dataset Description}
In this chapter we will present all the attributes contained in the dataset pointing which of them are considered or not.

\section{Publication}
Publication represent the central concept of the system. In the dataset, through the profiling, we found over six thousands
publication node that contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\_id} is an alphanumeric string that is the primary key, that's because is unique and every
            nodes owns this parameter
    \item \textbf{title} represents the title of the publication
    \item \textbf{authors} is an array of authors that will be presented later
    \item \textbf{venue} defines an entity that will be presented later
    \item \textbf{year} represents the year of publication
    \item \textbf{keywords} is an array containing the tag of subjects faced in the publication
    \item \textbf{fos} is an array containing the fields of study of the publication
    \item \textbf{n\_citation} is the number of times that this publication has been mentioned
    \item \textbf{page\_start} defines the starting page of the publication. This attribute wasn't take into consideration
            because doesn't target the goal of the project
    \item \textbf{page\_end} defines the last page of the publication. This attribute wasn't take into consideration
            because doesn't target the goal of the project
    \item \textbf{lang} represents the language of the publication
    \item \textbf{volume} is the volume of the publication. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due to the
            presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{issue} refers to how many times a periodical has been published during that year. This attribute 
            wasn't take into consideration due to the presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{issn} is an identification code of a publication. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due
            to the presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{issn} is an identification code of a publication. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due
            to the presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{doi} Digital Object Identifier is a persistent identifier. We decided to take it into consideration
            due to an acceptable missing percentage, much lower than the one affecting issn or isbn attributes
    \item \textbf{pdf} contains a string that links to the publication PDF online. This attribute wasn't take into
            consideration due to the presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{url} contains an array of links to the publication resources online. This attribute wasn't take into
            consideration because doesn't target the goal of the project
    \item \textbf{abstract} is a string containing a brief summary of the contents of the paper
    \item \textbf{references} is an array of ids representing the publication mentioned
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\section{Author}
Author is the most present entity of the system with over eighteen thousands of nodes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\_id} is an alphanumeric string that is the primary key, that's because is unique and almost every nodes
            owns this parameter
    \item \textbf{name} is the name of the author
    \item \textbf{org} is a string that represents the organization in which the author works. It is used as an attribute 
            of the relationship \emph{Writes} described before
    \item \textbf{gid} is an identifier of the author. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due to the presence
            of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{orgid} is an identifier that represents the organization in which the author works. It is used as an 
            attribute of the relationship \emph{Writes} described before
    \item \textbf{orgs} is an array of organizations for which the author worked. This attribute wasn't take into 
            consideration due to the presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{email} is a string containing the email address of the author. This attribute wasn't take into
            consideration due to the presence of many missing or null values and because doesn't target the goal of the 
            project
    \item \textbf{orcid} Open Researcher and Contributor ID is a unique identifier for authors of scientific articles.
            This attribute is taken into consideration although is not always present
    \item \textbf{oid} is an identifier for the author. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due to the
            presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{bio} is a string that describes the author. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due to 
            the presence of many missing or null values   
    \item \textbf{sid} is an identifier for the author. This attribute wasn't take into consideration due to the
            presence of many missing or null values
    \item \textbf{org\_zh} is an identifier that represents the organization in which the author works. This attribute
            wasn't take into consideration due to the presence of many missing or null values
